('Rarely seen in the wild. Huge and vicious, it is capable of destroying entire cities in a rage.'),

('A POKéMON that has been over­ hunted almost to extinction. It can ferry people across the water.'),

('Capable of copying an enemy’s genetic code to instantly transform itself into a duplicate of the enemy.'),

('Its genetic code is irregular. It may mutate if it is exposed to radiation from element STONEs.'),

('Lives close to water. Its long tail is ridged with a fin which is often mistaken for a mermaid’s.'),

('It accumulates negative ions in the atmosphere to blast out 10000- volt lightning bolts.'),

('When storing thermal energy in its body, its temperature could soar to over 1600 degrees.'),

('A POKéMON that consists entirely of programming code. Capable of moving freely in cyberspace.'),

('Although long extinct, in rare cases, it can be genetically resurrected from fossils.'),

('A prehistoric POKéMON that died out when its heavy shell made it impossible to catch prey.'),

('A POKéMON that was resurrected from a fossil found in what was once the ocean floor eons ago.'),

('Its sleek shape is perfect for swim­ ming. It slashes prey with its claws and drains the body fluids.'),

('A ferocious, pre­ historic POKéMON that goes for the enemy’s throat with its serrated saw-like fangs.'),

('Very lazy. Just eats and sleeps. As its rotund bulk builds, it becomes steadily more slothful.'),

('A legendary bird POKéMON that is said to appear to doomed people who are lost in icy mountains.'),

('A legendary bird POKéMON that is said to appear from clouds while dropping enormous lightning bolts.'),

('Known as the legendary bird of fire. Every flap of its wings creates a dazzling flash of flames.'),

('Long considered a mythical POKéMON until recently when a small colony was found living underwater.'),

('A mystical POKéMON that exudes a gentle aura. Has the ability to change climate conditions.'),

('An extremely rarely seen marine POKéMON. Its intelligence is said to match that of humans.'),

('It was created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments.'),

('So rare that it is still said to be a mirage by many experts. Only a few people have seen it worldwide.');
